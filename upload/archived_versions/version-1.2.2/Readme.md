# Introducing the Scaffolds mod!

Enhance your duplicants' mobility with this instantly deployed scaffold. Place it in any non-tile cell, yes even directly on top of existing structures! You will get temporary ladder-like access without using any resources or taking any dupe time to build. Unlike ladders, these Scaffolds live in a different layer so they can give you a leg up in construction projects when you just want to reach that last corner without having to build and deconstruct annoying ladders that prevent you from placing the building you care about. The Scaffold self-destructs after 10 cycles, ensuring clean final builds as your colony reaches new heights!

Have you ever been planning out a build, placing buildings left-and-right only to realize at the end that there is no way for your dupes to climb around to reach everything? It's too late to add ladders, since a ladder can't be in the same tile as a planned building. Well, now you can just instantly add a few Scaffolds in the right spots and go on to your next exciting endeavour while your dupes queue up their work tasks.

Scaffolds are rickety eyesores, as such, there is a movement penalty when going up or down one plus a decor penalty.

**_Caution!_** Because these Scaffolds automatically deconstruct themselves after 10 cycles by default, if a dupe relies on a Scaffold to get somewhere they are likely to end up trapped when the Scaffold disappears. There is a toggle on each Scaffold that can be used to disable the automatic deconstruction for that Scaffold if you want a Scaffold to stay around forever. That setting can then be copied to other Scaffolds.

### Ideas for improvements

- Make the timer value configurable globally as a mod setting
- Allow the timer amount for each scaffold to be set individually
- Make the timer reset any time a dupe or bot uses the scaffold
- Make it possible to replace a scaffold with a ladder or plastic ladder
- Change the deconstruct tool options to have a checkbox for Scaffolds
- Use Attachment points (like the Ladder Bed does) to make sure scaffolds can only be used if connected to a floor
  - This is more of an aesthetic idea, since a scaffold's wheels hanging in the middle of the air is kind of awkward
- Make the decor penalty for the Scaffold configurable
- Make the travel speed for the Scaffold configurable
- Require some level of research to unlock Scaffolds?

### Known issues

- If you ever have less than 1 kg of ANY solid material available, then you will not be able to build a scaffold
- Using the deconstruct tool, you have to choose the All option to deconstruct a scaffold. Since they can be built on top of both buildings and backgrounds, I had to use a layer that doesn't show up in any of the existing deconstruct tool options.
- Some Buildings have elements that are drawn over the scaffold, which looks strange.
