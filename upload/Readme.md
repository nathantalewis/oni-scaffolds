# Introducing the Scaffolds mod!

Enhance your duplicants' mobility with this instantly deployed scaffold. Place it in any non-tile cell, yes even directly on top of existing structures! You will get temporary ladder-like access without using any resources or taking any dupe time to build. Unlike ladders, these Scaffolds live in a different layer so they can give you a leg up in construction projects when you just want to reach that last corner without having to build and deconstruct annoying ladders that prevent you from placing the building you care about. The Scaffold self-destructs after 10 cycles, ensuring clean final builds as your colony reaches new heights!

Have you ever been planning out a build, placing buildings left-and-right only to realize at the end that there is no way for your dupes to climb around to reach everything? It's too late to add ladders, since a ladder can't be in the same tile as a planned building. Well, now you can just instantly add a few Scaffolds in the right spots and go on to your next exciting endeavour while your dupes queue up their work tasks.

Scaffolds are rickety eyesores, as such, there is a movement penalty when going up or down one plus a decor penalty.

**_Caution!_** Because these Scaffolds automatically deconstruct themselves after 10 cycles by default, if a dupe relies on a Scaffold to get somewhere they are likely to end up trapped when the Scaffold disappears. There is a toggle on each Scaffold that can be used to disable the automatic deconstruction for that Scaffold if you want a Scaffold to stay around forever. That setting can then be copied to other Scaffolds.

### Mod Options

You can configure the Scaffolds Mod to best suit your play style. From the main screen, choose Mods and then press the Options button on the Scaffolds mod.

- Permanent by Default: If you set this to true, then all new scaffolds you place will default to being permanent scaffolds. Once a scaffold is built, you can still toggle it to self-destruct with the button in the info card.
- Duration: The number of cycles that non-permanent scaffolds live before they self-destruct.
- Decor Penalty Value: How ugly Scaffolds will be. Higher values mean more of a penalty. For reference, normal Ladders have a decor penalty of 5.
- Decor Penalty Radius: How many tiles away the decor penalty will be applied. For reference, normal Ladders have a radius of 1.
- Upwards Speed Penalty: How much slower dupes moving upwards on Scaffolds will be. This is a percent between 0 and 99, with 0 being no penalty and 99 preventing almost all movement.
- Downwards Speed Penalty: How much slower dupes moving downwards on Scaffolds will be. This is a percent between 0 and 99, with 0 being no penalty and 99 preventing almost all movement.

### Ideas for improvements

- Allow the timer amount for each scaffold to be set individually
- Make the timer reset any time a dupe or bot uses the scaffold
- Make it possible to replace a scaffold with a ladder or plastic ladder without it showing as red when trying to place them
- Use Attachment points (like the Ladder Bed does) to make sure scaffolds can only be used if connected to a floor
  - This is more of an aesthetic idea, since a scaffold's wheels hanging in the middle of the air is kind of awkward
- Require some level of research to unlock Scaffolds?

### Known issues

- If you ever have less than 1 kg of ANY buildable material available, then you will not be able to build a scaffold
- Sometimes the sound when a Scaffold is built becomes very distant and almost can't be heard
- Some Buildings have elements that are drawn over the scaffold, which looks strange.
